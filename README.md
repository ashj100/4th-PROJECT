Welcome to my FeedReader Testing

This web application is using Jasmine Library to test the functionality of the website. At the bottom of the site, you can see what Jasmine is testing and whether or not the specs are passing.

## Why this Project?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## What I learned?

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.Ÿç
